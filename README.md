**Fork Notes**
I've been using KeepNote for a number of years, mostly on Linux. Using it on Linux is much easier because it just uses the Python which is currently installed on the system along with the system libraries. Windows version is self-contained so it's hard to update.
I wanted to use the syntax highlight plugin that was developed by X and updated by me on Windows. However, this proven to be a quite difficult task which involved having me to recompile Keepnote with Python 2.7 to support the features necessary.
After many hours trying to make it work, I've finally worked it out and managed to get a fresh version of Keepnote compiled with Python 2.7 and syntax highlighting support.

Check the DEVELOP file for instructions on how to compile your own version.

**End of Fork notes**

**KeepNote is a note taking application that works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS X.** With KeepNote, you can store your class notes, TODO lists, research notes, journal entries, paper outlines, etc in a simple notebook hierarchy with rich-text formatting, images, and more. Using full-text search, you can retrieve any note for later reference.

KeepNote is designed to be cross-platform (implemented in Python and PyGTK) and stores your notes in simple and easy to manipulate file formats (HTML and XML). Archiving and transferring your notes is as easy as zipping or copying a folder.
